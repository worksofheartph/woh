	<p>In February, Works of Heart went to Negros Occidental for our yearly immersion & strategic planning. We want to spend our trips visiting past and current clients while appreciating and learning more about the country at the same time.</p>
	<p>It was a great time to be there because we also attended The Dream Project’s #7NEWJUANDERS, an event featuring seven outstanding Filipinos who are making an impact in their respective industries. Along with over 1000 students from Western and Central Visayas, we listened to the seven’s inspiring stories ranging from the fields of design, education, culinary arts, entrepreneurship, and sustainability.</p>
	<p>The following day was spent touring some of Northern Negros Occidental’s highlights: The Angry Christ Church in Victorias, famous for its abstract expressionist mural of Jesus in place of an altar; Peñalosa Farms, a zero-waste organic model farm; The Mansion, an 1920s home-turned-restaurant; the Hofileña Ancestral House which not only showcases antique furniture and knick knacks but also an impressive collection of Philippine art; and the essential Ruins, which we enjoyed at golden hour.</p>
	<p>As a born-and-bred Negrense, it felt refreshing to be a tourist in my own home, to see it through new eyes. I gained a newfound pride in the history, culture, and beauty of my province. During her #7NEWJUANDERS presentation, Chef Margarita Forés (whose roots are in Bago City) said, “Inspiration is what you’ve grown up with.” Finding that creative spark can be challenging, but sometimes you just need to take a closer look at the things around you—and in a beautiful country like ours, even the mundane can be a wonderful source of inspiration.</p>

	<p>We call our annual planning and immersion "Para!", used to stop a jeepney once you've arrived to a place, because it is a way for us to explore the Philippines, stop, and take a break from our busy work schedules. "Para" in english also translates to "for", defined as "having the purpose of". Ultimately, we want to ground ourselves with what it is all about by visiting our past and present clients, partners, and communities all over the country. </p>
