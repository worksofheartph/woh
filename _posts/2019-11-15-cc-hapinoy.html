excerpt: "Our journey began when we packed our bags and journeyed to a far-away land called Quezon City. It was Bel’s first time in the North, in contrast to Ena having spent  years there. Although we weren’t quite sure of what to expect, we were both really excited.

<p>Our journey began when we packed our bags and journeyed to a far-away land called Quezon City. It was Bel’s first time in the North, in contrast to Ena having spent  years there. Although we weren’t quite sure of what to expect, we were both really excited. After riding through the usual Katipunan traffic and into Varsity Hills, we arrived at a bright orange house with a big banner up front that read in large, rainbow letters; <strong><em>“HAPIHOUSE: HOME OF HAPINOY.”</em></strong>  From there, we knew we were in for some high, high energy. We entered the <em>Hapihouse</em> and met with Mark Ruiz, founder of Hapinoy, and his cheerful team.

<p>Hapinoy is a social enterprise founded by Bam Aquino and Mark Ruiz that partners with microentrepreneurs—particularly <em>sari-sari</em> store owners—through education, linkages to capital, new business opportunities, and technology enablement. They currently have 14,000 store partners and their main goal is to make sure these <em>titas</em> are future-proof—equipped with technology and training that will help them earn alongside other local businesses. </p>

<p>Hapinoy developed a mobile app called Bizmo to enable these <em>sari-sari</em> store owners to offer mobile-based services such as loading, Smart Padala, and bills payment. Also included in this app is a feature called HapiShop, which enables <em>sari-sari</em> stores to sell gadgets and appliances to their neighbors without holding inventory in their stores. Although very valuable, Mark shared with us that their main pain point for this service is low adoption rate—only 1% of their partner stores actively uses HapiShop. We set out to meet the <em>titas</em> to ask their personal experience with HapiShop.</p>

<p>On our first immersion day we made our way to Langka street, a busy neighborhood consisting of a school, residential housing, a car repair shop, and of course, a couple of <em>sari-sari</em> stores. In one of them, we met our first<em>tita</em>, Tita Sandra. She is tagged as an active user as she had already incorporated Bizmo into her business services. We talked to her and learned about her daily life, the inner workings of her <em>sari-sari</em> store, and her experiences with selling appliances and gadgets through through the app. She told us about how people had really taken to the service at the beginning, with 2–3 items sold within just the first week! </p>

<p>Although she has had some success with HapiShop, she also talked about her hardships and how customers had difficulties with the requirements, slow processing, and inconsistencies with tracking down payments and penalties. She told us horror stories of her house being broken into and customers running off without completing their installments. Despite the disheartenment in both her and her customers, she showed true grit and real initiative in the way she made trackers out of index cards just to make it all work. </p>

<img src="../../../assets/images/blog-cc-hapinoy/hapinoyblog-06.jpg"><br/>

<p>We then proceeded to our next store owner, Tita Imelda. She told us about how their <em>sari-sari</em> store is their main source of income and, although there are several more  in the area, their neighborhood works together to sell different goods so as to avoid conflict of interest. She’s tagged as inactive but has actually tried selling a few times and almost sold five cell phones. Her almost customers said there are too many requirements and the process looked too complex for them. They would rather borrow money from a friend or family member then buy the item at the mall. This way they can see the item on-hand and get it fast. Tita Imelda decided to not pursue selling through HapiShop as she has other modes of income.</p>


<img src="../../../assets/images/blog-cc-hapinoy/hapinoyblog-07b.jpg"><br/>

<p>After hearing the stories from the <em>titas</em>, we asked Mark if we could see and learn firsthand how partner <em>titas</em> get recruited, how they first learn about the service, and what their initial reactions and questions are. Luckily, they had an ongoing field operation in another part of Quezon City that we could tag along. On our third day, we went around Project 4 with Kuya Joven and his team.</p>



<p>Armed with brown envelopes of recruitment materials and Google Maps, we went around street by street looking for all <em>sari-sari</em> stores in the area. The process was quick because each recruiter has a quota of eight  sign-ups per day. We were able to go to around 20 stores in two hours and  got six  sign-ups. The way they do it is to ask the <em>sari-sari</em> store owner if they already offer GCash services. If they say no, Kuya Joven will offer them a free GCash application that comes with a store front poster. Once done, that’s when they offer an application for Bizmo service. Kuya Joven even demos the app through his phone, showing the list of products the owner can sell.</p>

<p>One thing is for sure: <em>titas</em> want to sell through HapiShop but the main barrier to the service is that their customers think the process is too complex;they also have doubts that they will actually get the items they want. This doubt causes them to consider and choose other alternatives like Home Credit or buying straight from SaveMore. </p>

<blockquote>We want to prioritize value and organize information that focuses on long term value for both<em>tita</em> and customers.</blockquote>

<p>Through our analysis of the service and the<em>tita</em> journey (a user journey diagram of the <em>titas</em>),  we realized that this customer thinking is reflective of how the <em>titas</em> get their information about the service. There is no one source of information about HapiShop, its process, and its value. Without full and clear knowledge of the service, it’s harder for the <em>titas</em> to transfer the value to the customers.</p>

<p>The objective of our design proposal is to strengthen the <em>sari-sari</em> store experience.  We want to prioritize value and organize information that focuses on long term value for both<em>tita</em> and customers. We also want to build credibility by equipping everyone with confidence and knowledge, and making sure all the materials are cohesive with the brand. We did a lot! Our proposal is composed of four  things, one for each person involved in this service whom we had the pleasure of meeting and hearing their stories.</p>

<p><strong>HapiShop brand refresh</strong><br/>
The goal of this refresh is to visually connect it more to the Hapinoy brand with added element of credibility. We envision this to be more fun and welcoming to the community!</p>

<p><strong>HapiShop mobile app redesign</strong><br/>
We applied the brand refresh to their main platform! We wanted to make it look more like an e-shop and add new features like an info guide and improved payment tracker.

<p><strong>Tita Kit</strong><br/>
Last but not least, we created a kit for our <em>titas</em>. Highly grounded in their stories and their customers’ pain points.
</p>

<p>Through this experience, we got a glimpse into the lives of the <em>sari-sari</em> store <em>titas</em> and helped find ways to bridge them to their customers and to the services that Hapinoy offers using design! We are thankful to witness how hard they work and how much they do, not just for their families, but for the community as a whole. </p>
