			<p>In Southeast Asia alone, child mortality due to conditions such as diarrhea and pneumonia can be halved by advocating optimal breastfeeding practices. Unfortunately, the situation in the Philippines is this: the country faces a lack of medical support systems and programs catered specifically to breastfeeding.</p>

			<p>Mothers who face these dilemmas most often opt to go for other alternatives such as formula or other milk substitutes. While these are viable choices, what we recognized in our conservations with the founders of Nurtury was that the breastfeeding options for these mothers was not yet exhausted. Access to proper and sustained medical support, in this case, can help provide much-needed relief. That is—if they can be made readily available.</p>

			<h5>Caring for our mothers</h5>
			<p>The struggle or inability to breastfeed affects mothers from different backgrounds. Whether due to specific medical conditions, low levels of breast milk supply, or lack of general knowledge, a multitude of factors affect the breastfeeding practices in the country.</p>

			<p>Though information and knowledge about breastfeeding is available in different sources (clinics, online groups, and more), the absence of a dedicated and approachable authority may be enough to defer mothers from seeking out this avenue. We found it was strategic of Nurtury to want to establish themselves at a community level first—after all, the highest priority was reaching out to local mothers.</p>

			<blockquote>The work affects the women in our lives, especially during such vulnerable times... our work with Nurtury should be able to string together the medical expertise with support that is warm, thoughtful, and truly compassionate.</blockquote>

			<h5>Making spaces for women</h5>
			<p>Working with Nurtury on their goal to empower mothers is work that inevitably comes with an emotional responsibility. The work affects the women in our lives, especially during such vulnerable times. It was impossible for us to not take that into account—our work with Nurtury should be able to string together the medical expertise with support that is warm, thoughtful, and truly compassionate.</p>
			
			<h5>Speaking the language</h5>
			<p>The visual identity system we crafted made sure that each brand material was capable of reaching them and communicating to them. We focused on evoking, first, a sense of expertise, thereby assuring them that they’re coming to the right people, and second, a sense of comfort, thereby encouraging them to engage with the use of calming design elements. </p>

			<blockquote>The logo we created emphasizes the simplicity of motherhood, and highlights the three important factors, which is the mother, the child, and the love between them.</blockquote>

			<p>These two aspects are central to Nurtury’s main strategy. Whether through the professional print materials or other similar paraphernalia, the goal is not only aiding but empowering the mothers throughout their journey, from booking an appointment with Nurtury up to actually getting a prescription. </p>

			<p>The logo we created emphasizes the simplicity of motherhood, and highlights the three important factors, which is the mother, the child, and the love between them. We wanted to represent these three aspects into a simple logo that embodies the brand as a whole.</p>

			<h5>Celebrating motherhood</h5>
			<p>Supporting the mothers and the Filipino family is the core of our work with Nurtury. Hopefully, in this journey for accessible and quality breastfeeding support systems, we can reassure the women in our lives that motherhood is something that we can celebrate together.</p>
