			<p>The modern day planner—in all its 21st century glory—has been a staple for young professionals in every field and industry. Daily planners, however, have come to always prioritize the never-ending roster of things to do. While we all want to stay on top of our to-do-lists, there should also be a way to put things in the right balance, to have our personal projects and goals come to the fore. </p>

			<h5>STARTING WITH THE DETAILS</h5>
			<p>The Araw-araw planner was born out of the idea that we can make time for our passions and interests, one day at a time. We conducted a survey among a mix of students and employees whose hobbies ranged from physical activities like yoga to more creative pursuits such as producing music. When asked what makes it difficult for them to enjoy their hobbies, the top two responses were being busy with work and mismanaging their time. More than half of the respondents said they already regularly use a paper and/or digital planner. We saw the need for a different kind of planner that would encourage and guide these busy bees to pursue their passions, one day at a time.</p>

			<p>The Araw-araw planner features a minimal, undated layout, helping highlight the spaces one can use for energy and creativity, as well as allowing the user freedom to design their weeks however and whenever they desire. Hobby and personal project trackers—with schedule charts and space for goals—are at the beginning of the planner to guide the user’s year ahead. Logs for books read, films and TV shows watched, albums listened to, and trips taken also helps her chart the many digressions and diversions that accompany the year. The goal is to encourage her to pursue her activities and interests as much as possible.</p>

			<h5>STICKING TO A PLAN</h5>
			<p>Personal missions such as achieving a more balanced lifestyle or finally working on that dream project call for an internal change. Having a tangible instrument to work with, however, can help ensure that those shifts happen turn them into habits and realities. To do this, the planner, in a functional sense, must also work.</p>
			<p>Product design is the priority in Araw-araw. The planner utilizes rock paper, a durable and waterproof alternative to tree-based paper. A partnership with our friends at <a href="http://gouachebags.com" target="_blank">Gouache</a>—a local brand bag known for their waxed canvas products—resulted in a pen roll custom-fit for the planner, allowing for a convenient carry.  The pen roll secures the planner and holds writing instruments and small paper goods, so these are always within the user’s reach. When rolled up, the pen roll stands and serves as a convenient pen holder while the user jots down their plans.</p>
			<p>In a way, its design also goes beyond the project itself due to Araw-araw’s partnership with <a href="http://invested.ph" target="_blank">InvestEd</a>, a financial loan initiative for Filipino college students in need. Every planner purchased helps us give an InvestEd scholar a planner of their own. The intention behind this tie-up  is to encourage and inspire students to learn and grow within and beyond their classrooms.</p>

			<h5>REDISCOVERING THE SELF</h5>
			<p>A 21st century professional must be skilled in the art of multiple thinking: that is, the capacity to be aware of multiple timelines for multiple projects, with multiple other commitments waiting in the background. Being busy, unfortunately, comes at a cost—and so, we must find ways to rediscover in that multitude of deadlines the personal interests and leisures that matter to us. We start by writing them down, one day at a time.</p>
