    <h5>UPHOLDING OUR VALUES</h5>
    <div class="value">
      <h4>Design should always reflect the human experience</h4>
      <p>Works of Heart believes that good design happens when there is a conscious and strategic decision to reflect the brand’s story—when a design is created with a deep understanding of the community’s needs and insights of a human response. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="value">
      <h4>People with the same goal must work together</h4>
      <p>Our goals are simple: we want every Filipino to live a better life. And despite the simplicity of our goals, the path is difficult. The country is a work in progress—but for as long as we share the same goals as the partners we collaborate with it is a path we will always be willing to take.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="value">
      <h4>Beautiful stories must be heard</h4>
      <p>Stories help us connect with each other to navigate life’s complex social problems. Works of Heart was founded on the belief that everyone has a story and no matter how small or seemingly meaningless,  they all deserve to be heard.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="value">
      <h4>Design must be done for good</h4>
      <p>At the heart of everything we do, we design with integrity and strive for truth. Every decision we make and every output we create, we do to leave a positive impact in the lives of our fellow Filipinos. </p>
